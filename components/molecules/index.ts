/**
 * Barrel file for layout and utility components.
 *
 * This file re-exports modules from individual component files
 * (bottom-sheet, container, full-screen-loader, tabbar-icon, card, progress bar),
 * allowing them to be imported from a single entry point.
 *
 * Example:
 *   import { BottomSheet, Container } from '@tryftai/components';
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Simplifies import paths
 * - Keeps exports organized by feature/domain
 * - Makes it easier to scale and maintain shared components
